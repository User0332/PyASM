all kwargs must be passed in a dict because we might not know the names
  - have all natively impled funcs (like print) use a hashmap
  - have all python-defined funcs take in a hashmap but convert it to a dict within the func
  - this will not increase runtime but will reduce it because the hashmap-dict conversion will be happening anyway, this just omits it when it is not necessary (e.g. when a pure C function is accessing kwargs)

dunder methods have to be treated differently -- --
 - the struct member version of the dunder must be a C function
 - the symtab lookup (object form) of the dunder must be a function object
